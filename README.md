FE.py is based on the following git page: https://github.com/gorokhovnik/wine_analysis/

Main files include: 
1. points_regression.py - this runs a bayesian regression model on the wine data set using ADVI
2. points_regression_hierarchical.py - this runs a bayesian hierarchical regression model on the wine data set using ADVI
    - In this model we use hyperpriors for each continent on province to create the multi-level model
